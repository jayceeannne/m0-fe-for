# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I give myself 3 out of 5. I understand that it starts the loop to continue repeating the code.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I experienced a lot of unproductive struggle, I sat at my desk sulking in not being able to understand why my code would work ad then when i deleted it to record myslef i would get error codes.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to review the things we've learned so far because i catch myself reffering back to different articles to help me through understanding the new concepts. I took about 10 minutes looking for the code to type in terminal to clone a repo. little things like that add up. So i need to solidify what i've already learned.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
my only question is why when i ran all 3 codes it worked and then when i entered the same codes again it wouldn't function correctly? I was almost copy and pasting them to see if i was making an error but it simply wasn't working.
